I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter. You're a firestarter, twisted firestarter.

Early Release. More to come but beware of pesky bugs.

Features:
- `Greek fire` buildable floor material. Requires 1 chem fuel. When lit burns extremely hot and is not extinguished by rain.
- `Firestarter` ability. Pawns can start fires when drafted.
- Configuration settings for `Firestarter` ability, limiting it to Pyromaniacs or even disabling it.
- Changes to fire logic to make these mechanics work better.
