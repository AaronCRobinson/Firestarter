I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter. You're a firestarter, twisted firestarter.

# Important

**Early release**. Much more desired for this mod but want to hear some user feedback as I continue.

# Features
- `Greek fire` buildable floor material. Requires 1 chem fuel. When lit burns extremely hot and is not extinguished by rain.
- `Firestarter` ability. Pawns can start fires when drafted.
- Configuration settings for `Firestarter` ability, limiting it to Pyromaniacs or even disabling it.
- Changes to fire logic to make these mechanics work better.
- Arrows shot beside campfires or torches will become flaming and start fires where they land.  

# Requirements

**This mod requires JecsTools to run properly.**
https://github.com/jecrell/JecsTools

While it is not a requirement it is likily this mod will cause performance issues. These fires will not be put out by rain and can get extremely large. Please follow another mod I am working on called NoFireWatcher which will work to improve fire performance during these periods.
